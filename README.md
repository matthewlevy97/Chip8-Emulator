# CHIP-8 Emulator
This is my attempt at making a basic emulator in ONE DAY!!! I however failed due to some graphics / keyboard input bugs taking a bit longer to debug, but all core features where completed in the first day. Because of this, there is probably (almost positively) horribly slow/bad code in here, but it works.

# Usage
./emulator-chip8 [CHIP8 Program]

# Keyboard Mapping
The keyboard maps in the following way to the original device
-  Original          Emulator
- 1  2  3  C  -->>  1  2  3  4
- 4  5  6  D  -->>  Q  W  E  R
- 7  8  9  E  -->>  A  S  D  F
- A  0  B  F  -->>  Z  X  C  V

# TODO
- Graphics bug reshowing sprites on second collision
    - Breakout blocks reappearing if hit twice
